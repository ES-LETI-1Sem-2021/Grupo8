The project's main goal is to get information about software projects, following the Scrum directives. We developed a Java Desktop App that uses the GitHub and Trello platforms as our data sources (  GITHUB: https://docs.github.com/pt/rest, TRELLO: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/apiintroduction/ and https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/api-group-actions/). With this app, the user has some options when it comes to what type of information he wants displayed, both for Trello and GitHub.
